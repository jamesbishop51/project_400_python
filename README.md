# project_400_python
The following is my adaptation of facial_req. Pi available from https://github.com/carolinedunn/facial_recognition.
My additions are to add my own notification system using firebase and android when a face has been detected and to upload an image of that face. 
This is intended to run along with the facial_recognition and opencv and is set up for the raspberry pi 4 running buster os and a pi camera version 1.4
