# project_400_python
the following is my adaptaion of facial_req.py availble from https://github.com/carolinedunn/facial_recognition.
my adations are to add my own notifaction system when a face has been detected and to upload an image of that face. 
this is intented to run along with the facial_recognition and opencv and is set up for the raspberry pi 4 running buster os and a pi camera version 1.4
